          <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). 
      The main difference with VCS is its distributed form, which means that 
      there is not a single repository centralizing all the code history.
          <br/>All the code history is in each repository, which
      means that you have all the history in your local repository as well as in the others. 
        </p>
        <p>      
      Git works like the following figure: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>you add new or modified files and remove deleted files to your staging repository.</li>
          <li>when all your changes make sense you commit them to your local repository.</li>
          <li>now, you can share your modifications whith the rest of the world by pushing them to a remote repository.</li>
          <li>to get others' modifications pull or fetch them from a remote repository.</li>
        </ul>

      <subsection name="Why Git?">
        <p>Silverpeas is a free and libre project that values meritocracy. 
          <em>In code we believe!</em>
          <br/>
      As we switched to the Git distributed source control system, we heavily blured the distinction between official project developers and external contributors. 
      This makes it easier for you to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>prepare changes, and for us to eventually merge them</li>
          <li>maintain your own private modifications of Silverpeas</li>
          <li>later split your own modifications and submit them back to us.</li>
        </ul>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Github">
        <p>
          <img src="images/logos/logo_github.jpg" alt="github logo" style="height:40px;padding-right:10px;float:left;position:relative;" />
          Silverpeas's code is hosted on public Git repositories on GitHub, so that everybody can participate and contribute to the Silverpeas project.
          <br/>
          The Github features enhance the capabilities of a collaborative and distributed work.

    <section name="How to contribute">      
      <subsection name="Forking Silverpeas">
        <p>
          First, you have to 
          <a href="http://help.github.com/">create your account on Github</a>, then fork the 
          <a href="http://github.com/Silverpeas">Silverpeas repositories</a> you are interested in.
        </p>
        <p>Once the fork completed, clone it:</p>
        <source>git clone URL_OF_THE_FORK</source>
        <p>
          In order to keep your fork up-to-date, you will have to pull modifications from the Silverpeas repository. Thus, you 
          have to add a remote repository to your git configuration linking your local repository to the Silverpeas one. The
          recommanded name (used afterwards in he documentation) is 
          <code>silverpeas</code>.
          <br/> 
          To add a remote repository to your local, execute the following command:
        </p>
        <source>git remote add silverpeas URL_OF_SILVERPEAS_REPOSITORY</source>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <source>git remote add silverpeas git@github.com:Silverpeas/Silverpeas-Core.git</source>
        <p>To synchronize your local repository with Silverpeas, you have to execute the following command:</p>
        <source>git pull silverpeas master</source>          
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Creating a development branch">
        <p>Now that you have your own repository, let's create a branch to develop some code in it.
        The branch name should reflect the development feature or bug you are working on.
        </p>
        <source>git branch BRANCH_NAME</source>
        <p>Now you can checkout the branch you have created:</p>
        <source>git checkout  BRANCH_NAME</source>
        <p>When all your modifications are commited, it is ime to push them to your remote repository on a branch.</p>
        <source>git push origin BRANCH_NAME</source>
        <p>Now to associate the local and remote branch you have to execute the following command:</p>
        <source>git branch --track  origin/BRANCH_NAME</source>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Integrating your changes in Silverpeas">
        <p>Now that your development is ended, you may want to integrate it into Silverpeas.
          <br/>
        To do this we take advantage of 
          <a href="http://help.github.com/pull-requests/">Github's "Pull Request" feature</a>.
        </p>
        <p>On receiving you pull request, the Silverpeas core team will look into it and may give you some remarks.
          <br/>
        When your code is accepted it will be merged into Silverpeas master branch and you will be informed of this.
          <br/>
        Then you will have to synchronize your repository with Silverpeas's:
        </p>
        <source>git checkout master
git pull silverpeas master
        </source>
        <p>Your developmenet branches for the integrated code are now obsolete, so you may want to delete them.</p>
        <source>git branch -D origin/BRANCH_NAME
git branch -D BRANCH_NAME</source>
