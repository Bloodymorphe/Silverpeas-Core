    <title>Migrating from Silverpeas V4</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <section name="Upgrading from Silverpeas 5.1 to Silverpeas 5.2">
      <p>Before Silverpeas 5.2 there were <b>two</b> configuration files, with Silverpeas 5.2 the file
       <i>SilverpeasSettings.xml</i> has been splitted in two. Now you will find <i>config.xml</i> containing
       the part that has to be manually edited and <i>SilverpeasSettings.xml</i> which provides a default
       configuration for Silverpeas, overriden by creating a <i>CustomerSettings.xml</i>.<br/>
       If you don't have your own <i>CustomerSettings.xml</i>, all you have to do is copy the <i>SilverpeasSettings.xml</i>
       and redefine your configuration.</p>
       <p>On the Windows plateform another step is requied, you have to reinstall JBoss with the new package or
       you have to manually edit the <i>%JBOSS_HOME%\bin\run.bat</i> file and remove the line 77 (or add a <code>rem</code> before the command) :
       <source><![CDATA[set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Xms512m -Xmx512m]]></source></p>
    </section>
    <section name="Pre-requisite">
      <p>Silverpeas V5 can be installed over the last stable version of Silverpeas V4, a.k.a. Silverpeas
      V4 P410-M3. As Silverpeas V5 has only the migration scripts from this version, you <b>must</b> upgrade
      to Silverpeas V4 P410-M3 before any migration to Silverpeas V5.<br/>
      </p>
      <subsection name="Preparing the new installation">
        <p>Silverpeas needs a Java SE Development Kit (JDK) at least of version 6, which can be downloaded from Sun
          <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp#jdk">here</a>.<br/>
          Don't forget to set-up the environment variable <code>%JAVA_HOME%</code>.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Apache Maven">
        <p>Apache Maven 2.2.x is used in Silverpeas for the building of  components and the assembly. It must be installed on the target platform.<br/>
          For correct installation, see <a href="http://www.sonatype.com/books/maven-book/reference/installation.html">Maven - The Definitive Guide</a>
        </p>
        <p>For more information about Apache Maven, please see the
          <a href="http://maven.apache.org">their website</a> or
          <a href="http://www.sonatype.com/books/maven-book/reference/">download the ebook</a>
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Environment Variables">
        <p>In order for Silverpeas V5 to run ,the follwing environment variables <b>must</b> have been set :</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>%SILVERPEAS_HOME%</code> : pointing to the installation directory of Silverpeas.</li>
          <li><code>%$JBOSS_HOME%</code> : pointing to the installation directory of JBoss.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These variables should be available to the user running Silverpeas. With <i>FireDaemon</i> on Windows that means
        that the variables should be set as system variables.</p>
      </subsection>
    </section>
    <section name="Configuration">
      <subsection name="Configuring the JDBC Driver">
        <p>Silverpeas default configuration is using Postgresql, but if you plan to use Oracle you need a special step to
        add the JDBC driver to Silverpeas. Edit the file <i>%SILVERPEAS_HOME%\bin\pom.xml</i> and add the following code :</p>
        <ul>         
          <li>Oracle : 
          <source><![CDATA[
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.oracle</groupId>
    <artifactId>ojdbc6</artifactId>
    <version>11.2.0.1.0</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>]]></source>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, you need to install the Oracle JDBC driver in your local repository with the following command :</p>
        <source><![CDATA[
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.oracle -DartifactId=ojdbc6 -Dpackaging=jar -Dversion=11.2.0.1.0 -DgeneratePom=true -Dfile=/path/to/jar]]></source>
        </subsection>
      <subsection name="Configuring Silverpeas">
        <p>Now, you have to edit your configuration file : <i>%SILVERPEAS_HOME%\setup\settings\CustomerSettings.xml</i>
        in order to take into account your new environment. The configuration is quite simple : you have to replace all
        <code>$SILVERPEAS_HOME\silverpeas\</code> with <code>$SILVERPEAS_HOME\</code>.<br/>
        In order to keep your existing data, you have to edit the provided <i>%SILVERPEAS_HOME%\setup\settings\SilverpeasSettings.xml</i>
        to define the correct directory to your data root directory.</p>
