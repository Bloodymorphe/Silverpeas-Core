/**
 * The custom logging solution for Silverpeas.
 * </p>
 * The Java ecosystem is rich in logging solutions as it was no standard solution provided by
 * Java until Java 1.5. In order to be agnostic to any logging solutions and to be able to change
 * in the time, Silverpeas has defined its own solution with the goal to wrap any possible logging
 * subsystem.
